# OpenGL Basic Scene Modelling and Shaders
## Basic Overview
The project showcases the fundmentals of basic 3D modelling using OpenGL,as well as Shader programming and effects and of course C++ Design Principles.
## Used Techniques
### Dynamic Lighting

- Implements Phong lighting model for realistic light interaction with surfaces.
- Includes two point lights and one directional light to demonstrate various lighting effects.
- Allows for real-time manipulation of light sources to observe changes in the scene illumination.

### Texture Mapping

- Demonstrates the application of textures to 3D models for added realism.
- Utilizes both diffuse and specular maps to enhance the material properties of objects.
- Transparency Support: Implements alpha blending for textures that require transparency, adding depth and complexity to scenes.
## Controls

- `W/A/S/D`: Move the camera. 
- Mouse Input – miscare target/orientare camera 
- I & J – miscare campfire cu tot cu lumina
- R – Turul Scenei prin interpolare 
- F – Vizualizare Wireframe  
- G – Vizualizare Point
